# 🩺🏋️‍♀️ BMI Calculator in Python  

## 📖 Overview  
This project is a simple yet effective **Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator** built using **Python**. It takes a user’s height and weight as input, calculates their BMI, and classifies their health status according to standard BMI categories (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese).  

The project demonstrates the use of **conditional statements**, **user input handling**, and **basic arithmetic operations** — all essential foundations for Python programming.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Building an interactive Python program for BMI calculation.  
- Learning how to handle user input and display formatted output.  
- Applying conditional logic to categorize BMI levels.  
- Practicing simple, real-world Python programming.

## 🧩 Tools and Concepts Used  
- **Python**  
- **Input/Output operations** (`input()` and `print()`)  
- **Conditional Statements** (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  
- **Arithmetic operations**  
- **Formatting output and rounding results**
