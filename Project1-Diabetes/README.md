# 🩺 Diabetic Patients' Hospital Records (MySQL & Power BI Project)

This folder contains my SQL-based data analysis project on diabetic patients’ hospital records, plus Microsoft Power BI visualizations.

## 📊 Project Overview
This project explores a large real-world dataset of over 100,000 diabetic patient encounters across multiple hospitals in the United States.  
The analysis focuses on **medication usage patterns**, **treatment outcomes**, and **demographic trends** using MySQL.
